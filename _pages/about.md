Welcome to my page! My name is Dunyao Xue, a second-year PhD student at the [Institute of Statistics and Big Data](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China, advised by [Dr. Cheng Meng](https://cheng-bdal.github.io//).

Prior to this, I received a BSc degree in Mathematics from the [Cuiying Honors School](https://cycollege.lzu.edu.cn/), Lanzhou University.

My current research focuses on `big data compression`, `optimal transport`, and `large language model architectures`.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to drop me an email!
