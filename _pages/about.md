Welcome to my page! My name is Dunyao Xue, a second-year PhD student at the Institute of Statistics and Big Data, Renmin University of China, advised by Dr. Cheng Meng.

Prior to this, I received a BSc degree in Mathematics from the `Cuiying Honors School`, Lanzhou University.

My current research focuses on `big data compression`, `optimal transport`, and `large language model architectures`.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to drop me an email
